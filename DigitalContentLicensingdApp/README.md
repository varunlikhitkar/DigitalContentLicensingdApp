# Digital Content Licensing dApp

## Project Title
**Digital Content Licensing dApp**

## Project Description
The Digital Content Licensing dApp is a decentralized application that facilitates the licensing of digital media such as music, art, or photos. Creators can license their content, and smart contracts manage the payment and usage rights, ensuring a transparent and automated process for both content creators and licensees.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to empower content creators to securely license their digital creations while providing licensees with a trusted and transparent system to obtain usage rights. The platform aims to remove intermediaries, reduce costs, and ensure creators retain control over how their content is used.

## Key Features
- **Content Licensing**: Allows creators to license their digital media by specifying a license fee.
- **Automated Payment Management**: Smart contracts manage the licensing fee and usage rights, ensuring transparent and tamper-proof transactions.
- **Approval System**: Licensees can request licenses, and creators can approve or reject them.
- **Immutable Records**: All licensing agreements are stored immutably on the blockchain.
